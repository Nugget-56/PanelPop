# PanelPop
Dashtoon assignment

The website is not responsive at this point in time, so please open it on a laptop! I will try to make it responsive within a day

Here is the landing page of my website which takes you to the editing area for your comic panel

I went with popup instructions instead so the users can go through them again even while editing without losing any work

Users can generate the images and it will be shown in the leftmost box after loading ends

After editing the image they can add it to any selected panel. There are edit and delete button within every panel for its respective image but the edit button on the panel is not working right now (Fixing it!)

Other than that, the user can also change the panel gap, border width and colour according to their prefrences. Finally, they can download the comic panel to their devices.
